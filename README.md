Hi there! This is a mod for the ROG Ally that adds a second clamshell screen!

Its pretty thick since I could not source a thinner 7 inch screen than the one used here so take this mod as more for fun than anything.

It can be folded back to act as a stand too!

**The parts list and links are at the bottom of the page :)**

## Putting The Screen Together:

1. The screen has two hdmi ports so the outside one can be removed either by desoldering or I just snipped mine off. Same with the 3.5mm aux port. We will only be using the ports circled in red.

2. Plug the screen into the ally with the dock using the hdmi and micro usb ribbons to make sure that its all working.

3. Set the brightness of the monitor with the wheel while everything is connected with the dock. 

4. Unplug the screen so it is now off and either desolder or snip off the adjustment wheel.

6. Take the dock and using a pry tool or something strong, pop off the plastic from around the ports and the plastic around teh wire. Once these are removed, the actual board of the dock and wire should slide out.

7. Using mounting tape, mount the dock to the back of the screen and route the HDMI and Micro USB cables.

8. Drop this whole thing into the printed screen housing and feed the dock wire through the hole in the printed back cover.

9. Glue the docks usbc to the wire housing and then glue the wire housing onto the back cover. 

10. Plug the usbc into the ally with the extention to check if everything is working. If it is, you can glue the back cover to the housing.


## Mounting The Screen To The Ally:

You will need to thread the rod through the housing with the hinge parts on either side. Washers are placed on either side of the hinge parts to distribute the pressure more evenly.

One the other side of the hinge, you need to put the hinge mount instead of the housing. Please look at the photo for reference.

Now you can place the screen on the ally and glue the hinge mount to the back of your Ally so that everything lines up.

Once the glue dries, tighten the lock nuts so that the hinge has the amount of pressure to hold the screen and the mod is done!
